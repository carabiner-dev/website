Founded in 2025, our company launched with the help and support of open source
maintainers focused on supply chain security problems.

## Our Mission

Carabiner Systems was formed to bridge the gap preventing mature supply chain
technologies from becoming operational in organizations.

## Our Vision

Carabiner is building a platform to help organizations seamlessly introduce
security best practices and technologies into their current software build
processes.
